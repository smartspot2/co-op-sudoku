## Inspiration
Sudoku is fun, but can be boring alone. We wanted to make a cooperative version of sudoku that people can play together.

## What it does
Each player is given a limited view of the board. Players must work together to overcome this limitation to solve the entire puzzle.

## How we built it
Backend that generates and solves puzzles, with limitations on player POV:
- asldfj
- lsakdjf

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Experience using numpy and implementing recursive / brute force algorithms on arrays.

## What's next for Sudokuop
More challenging puzzle generation. Increase solving / generation efficiency to make larger (ex. 25 x 25) sudoku boards more practical.
